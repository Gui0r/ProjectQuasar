# Day 1 Testing Report

## 1. Overview

The initial test was conducted using a standard paper airplane model, which was originally employed in a 2023 school championship. The objective was to evaluate the aerodynamic performance and identify areas for improvement.

## 2. Observations and Initial Findings

- **Aerodynamic Instability:**  
  The model exhibited noticeable oscillations during flight, indicating aerodynamic instability.

## 3. Modifications and Iterative Improvements

- **Wing Curvature Adjustment:**  
  To address the instability, we reduced the curvature of the wings. This modification resulted in enhanced stability during flight.

- **Launch Technique:**  
  - **Initial Approach:** The initial launch involved applying significant force.  
  - **Revised Approach:** Subsequent tests revealed that a lighter launch provided better precision and stability. The reduced launch force minimized disturbances, leading to more consistent flight trajectories.

## 4. Performance Metrics

- **Distance Covered:**  
  - **Before Adjustments:** The maximum distance achieved was approximately 8 meters.  
  - **After Adjustments:** With the implemented modifications, the model achieved a distance of up to 16 meters.

## 5. Conclusion and Next Steps

The modifications made on Day 1—specifically the reduction in wing curvature and the adjustment of the launch technique—demonstrated significant improvements in both the stability and distance of the paper airplane. Further tests will focus on fine-tuning these parameters and exploring additional aerodynamic enhancements.
